# employee_salary_prediction
 This project predicts employee salaries using machine learning on a dataset with features like job role, education, and experience. It involves data preprocessing, model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest), and evaluation to help HR make data-driven salary decisions

 
## ðŸ“˜ Project Title:
Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description:
The Employee Salary Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the salary (or monthly income) of employees based on various personal, performance, and organizational attributes. The dataset used, named employee.csv,contains detailed records of employees, including their demographic information, job roles, education, performance metrics, and more.
By leveraging this data, we aim to uncover patterns and key factors influencing employee compensation, which can support HR departments in making data-driven decisions regarding recruitment, promotions, and compensation planning.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description:
The dataset includes features such as:
EmployeeID
Gender
EducationLevel
JobRole
YearsAtCompany
MonthlyIncome (Target Variable)
PerformanceRating
Department
JobSatisfaction
OverTime
And many others...
Most features are either categorical or numerical, with MonthlyIncome being the continuous target variable to predict.

## Challenges:
Handling categorical features like job role, department, gender, etc.
Dealing with multicollinearity and feature scaling.
Evaluating regression performance accurately.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

## Libraries:
pandas, numpy for data handling
matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
scikit-learn for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

## Models Used:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor

## ðŸš€ Workflow Data Collection:
The dataset is uploaded as a ZIP file and extracted using Python.
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Label Encoding for categorical variables
Feature Scaling using Standard Scaler
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots
Correlation heatmaps
Outlier analysis
Model Building
Linear Regression as a baseline model
Random Forest Regressor for improved performance



Metrics used: 
Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score
Visualization of actual vs predicted values



## ðŸ“Š Expected Outcomes:
Accurate salary predictions for new or existing employees
Identification of important features affecting salary (e.g., Job Role, Experience, Education)
Insights into employee compensation structure

## âœ… Conclusion: 
project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied in the HR domain to estimate salaries based on structured data. The predictive model can help organizations in fair compensation planning, reducing biases, and understanding employee value drivers more comprehensively.
